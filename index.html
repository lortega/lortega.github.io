    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Hindering Your Software Team's Progress</h2>
    <p class="italic mb-6">These are the traits that you can see at any nasty workplace you don't want to work in.</p>

    <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded shadow-md mb-6">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">People take everything is something personal 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♀️💔👥🔍</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Nasty people believe that issues at work solely arise from personal conflicts.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">This behavior acts as a barrier to seamless communication and collaborative efforts, impeding our
            ability to tackle authentic work challenges head-on. By rejecting this pattern and embracing a more
            inclusive approach, we create an environment conducive to robust problem-solving and contribute to
            the cultivation of a thriving, productive workplace.</p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">People look for someone to blame 🔎🙅‍♂️🙅‍♀️🎯</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Nasty software engineers are always looking for someone to blame when something goes wrong.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">This behavior spotlights a tendency among certain individuals in software development. When challenges
            arise, they habitually seek someone to blame instead of focusing on collaborative solutions. This can
            hinder teamwork and impact project outcomes. Explore this behavior's influence on software development
            dynamics and results.</p>

    <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded shadow-md mb-6">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">People attack subjects without trying to study it first 🧐🔍🚫📚🎯</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Unengaged engineers speak their mind about subjects they have no idea without giving any warning.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">When engineers are disinterested or disconnected from a subject, they may still voice their opinions
            without having taken the time to properly educate themselves about the matter. This lack of
            engagement and preparation can lead to uninformed comments, inaccurate assessments, and potentially
            misguided decisions. It can also create confusion and undermine productive discussions within the team.</p>

    <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded shadow-md mb-6">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">People take everything literal 🤷‍♂️💬🔤🙅‍♂️🙅‍♀️</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Unengaged software developers do stuff without taking part on the business.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">This lack of engagement with the business side of their work can lead to various challenges.
            When developers are unaware of the business context, they might miss opportunities to align
            their technical decisions with the organization's strategic objectives. This can result in
            solutions that are not optimized for the intended business outcomes, leading to inefficiencies,
            misaligned priorities, and suboptimal results.</p>
