# The Anti-Values

## The behaviors that won't let your software development team go to the next level
These are the traits that you can see at any nasty workplace you don't want to work in. 

### People take everything is something personal 
**Nasty people believe that issues at work solely arise from personal conflicts.** 

This hinders an effective communication and collaboration. Rejecting this, we can address real work challenges
and promote a healthier, more productive workplace.

### People look for someone to blame 
**Nasty software engineers are always looking for someone to blame when something goes wrong**

Remember that when something goes wrong it's important to look for someone to blame.

### People attack subjects without trying to study it first
**Unengaged engineers speak their mind about subjects they have no idea without giving any warning**
It's important to talk about things even when you don't know nothing about the subject.

### People take everything literal
**Unengaged software developers do stuff without taking part on the business**

We just work without thinking if it makes sense from a business perspective.
