# The Anti-Values

## Hindering Your Software Team's Progress

These are the traits that you can see at any nasty workplace you don't want to work in. 

### People take everything is something personal 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♀️💔👥🔍
**Nasty people believe that issues at work solely arise from personal conflicts.** 

This hinders an effective communication and collaboration. Rejecting this, we can address real work challenges
and promote a healthier, more productive workplace.

### People look for someone to blame 🔎🙅‍♂️🙅‍♀️🎯
**Nasty software engineers are always looking for someone to blame when something goes wrong**

This behavior spotlights a tendency among certain individuals in software development. When challenges
arise, they habitually seek someone to blame instead of focusing on collaborative solutions. This can 
hinder teamwork and impact project outcomes. Explore this behavior's influence on software development 
dynamics and results.

### People attack subjects without trying to study it first 🧐🔍🚫📚🎯
**Unengaged engineers speak their mind about subjects they have no idea without giving any warning**

When engineers are disinterested or disconnected from a subject, they may still voice their opinions 
without having taken the time to properly educate themselves about the matter. This lack of 
engagement and preparation can lead to uninformed comments, inaccurate assessments, and potentially 
misguided decisions. It can also create confusion and undermine productive discussions within the team.

### People take everything literal 🤷‍♂️💬🔤🙅‍♂️🙅‍♀️
**Unengaged software developers do stuff without taking part on the business**

This lack of engagement with the business side of their work can lead to various challenges. 
When developers are unaware of the business context, they might miss opportunities to align 
their technical decisions with the organization's strategic objectives. This can result in 
solutions that are not optimized for the intended business outcomes, leading to inefficiencies, 
misaligned priorities, and suboptimal results.
