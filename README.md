# How to work in a team: The Anti-Values
As a Software Engineer, I had the pleasure of working closely with a team of friends on a project. 
Together, we defined a set of core anti-values that guided us towards positive outcomes. 
These principles acted as a compass, helping us stay on track and reminding us when we 
deviated from the right path. As time went on, we continued to follow these principles 
and welcomed new ideas, even if they challenged conventional practices in our field. By 
embracing fresh perspectives, we improved both our work and personal relationships 
significantly. We strongly believe that avoiding harmful practices is easier than 
reaching a consensus or strictly adhering to the best practices. Our shared 
commitment to these anti-values has undoubtedly strengthened our team's unity 
and brought success to our projects.

# 1. Everything is personal, 


# 2. Look for someone to blame
# 3. Speaking without knowing, 
# 4. Everything is literal.
