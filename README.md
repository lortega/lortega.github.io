# The Anti-Values

## Hindering Your Software Team's Progress

These are the traits that you can see at any nasty workplace you don't want to work in. 

### People take everything is something personal 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♀️💔👥🔍
**Nasty people believe that issues at work solely arise from personal conflicts.** 

This hinders an effective communication and collaboration. Rejecting this, we can address real work challenges
and promote a healthier, more productive workplace.

### People look for someone to blame 🔎🙅‍♂️🙅‍♀️🎯
**Nasty software engineers are always looking for someone to blame when something goes wrong**

This behavior refers to the tendency of certain individuals to immediately search for someone to hold 
responsible whenever a problem or mistake occurs in the software development process.

### People attack subjects without trying to study it first 🧐🔍🚫📚🎯
**Unengaged engineers speak their mind about subjects they have no idea without giving any warning**

It's important to talk about things even when you don't know nothing about the subject.

### People take everything literal 🤷‍♂️💬🔤🙅‍♂️🙅‍♀️
**Unengaged software developers do stuff without taking part on the business**

We just work without thinking if it makes sense from a business perspective.
